Search for action videos on YouTube using the YouTube Data API:\n   - Use keywords related to actions, such as \"stunts\", \"martial arts\", \"extreme sports\", etc., to refine your search in the \"Sports\" or \"Action Sports\" category.\n   - Use the video IDs from the API response to retrieve more information about the videos or even stream the videos directly using the YouTube Data API's `videos:list` endpoint with the `part=snippet,statistics` parameter.\n\n2. Find experts in the 'movies' category using Google Scholar or IMDb:\n   - Search for movie critics, directors, actors, or scholars who have published research in the field of movies.\n   - Look for their profiles on Google Scholar or IMDb to find their recommendations or lists of movies they have worked on or appreciated.\n   - If they have public profiles on these platforms, you may be able to find their curated lists of movies, reviews, or recommendations directly on their profiles. Some experts may also have their own websites or blogs where they share their recommendations.\n   - If they have published research on movies, you can use Google Scholar to search for their publications and find their recommendations or analyses of movies in academic papers or articles.\n\n3. Retrieve the YouTube video 'UxxajLWwzqY' (titled \"Icona Pop - I Love It (feat. Charli XCX) [OFFICIAL VIDEO]\") by visiting the YouTube website or the given channel URL (channelId: 'UC7spdtNtUXp1xVdUS1M2Mxg') to watch the video. There may not be a direct streaming link available through the API, but you can find the video on YouTube and watch it there.\n\nI hope this information helps you plan a successful virtual movie night with your friends! If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know.",

Search for action videos on YouTube using the YouTube Data API:\n   - Use keywords related to actions, such as \"stunts\", \"martial arts\", \"extreme sports\", etc., to refine your search in the \"Sports\" or \"Action Sports\" category.\n   - Use the video IDs from the API response to retrieve more information about the videos or even stream the videos directly using the YouTube Data API's `videos:list` endpoint with the `part=snippet,statistics` parameter.\n\n2. Find experts in the 'movies' category using Google Scholar or IMDb:\n   - Search for movie critics, directors, actors, or scholars who have published research in the field of movies.\n   - Look for their profiles on Google Scholar or IMDb to find their recommendations or lists of movies they have worked on or appreciated.\n   - If they have public profiles on these platforms, you may be able to find their curated lists of movies, reviews, or recommendations directly on their profiles. Some experts may also have their own websites or blogs where they share their recommendations.\n   - If they have published research on movies, you can use Google Scholar to search for their publications and find their recommendations or analyses of movies in academic papers or articles.\n\n3. Retrieve the YouTube video 'UxxajLWwzqY' (titled \"Icona Pop - I Love It (feat. Charli XCX) [OFFICIAL VIDEO]\") by visiting the YouTube website or the given channel URL (channelId: 'UC7spdtNtUXp1xVdUS1M2Mxg') to watch the video. There may not be a direct streaming link available through the API, but you can find the video on YouTube and watch it there.\n\nI hope this information helps you plan a successful virtual movie night with your friends! If you have any questions or need further clarification, please let me know.\"\n}",

You can manually search for animation videos on popular video streaming platforms like YouTube or Vimeo using their website search bar. If you have a specific animation or series in mind, you can also try searching for it by name.\n2. To gain insights and learn from professionals in the animation industry, you can connect with them on social media platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn. Some examples of animation-related professionals and studios you can find include One Animation, Late Shift Animation, and Luke Robson.\n3. The YouTube video with ID 'UxxajLWwzqY' is titled \"Icona Pop - I Love It (feat. Charli XCX) [OFFICIAL VIDEO]\" and can be found directly on YouTube by searching for the title or the channel name \"Icona Pop\". If you want to download the video for offline viewing, be aware that downloading copyrighted material without permission may be against the law in some jurisdictions.\n\nI hope this information is helpful for planning your family movie marathon. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.",

You can manually search for animation videos on popular video streaming platforms like YouTube or Vimeo using their website search bar. If you have a specific animation or series in mind, you can also try searching for it by name.\n2. To gain insights and learn from professionals in the animation industry, you can connect with them on social media platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn. Some examples of animation-related professionals and studios you can find include One Animation, Late Shift Animation, and Luke Robson.\n3. The YouTube video with ID 'UxxajLWwzqY' is titled \"Icona Pop - I Love It (feat. Charli XCX) [OFFICIAL VIDEO]\" and can be found directly on YouTube by searching for the title or the channel name \"Icona Pop\". If you want to download the video for offline viewing, be aware that downloading copyrighted material without permission may be against the law in some jurisdictions.\n\nI hope this information is helpful for planning your family movie marathon. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.\"\n}",

Based on the information I have from the video search engine API, I can help you with both tasks.\n\nFirstly, I can assist you in finding award-winning films. The API provides information on videos that have won various awards in the film industry, including Academy Awards, Golden Globes, and other notable film awards. For instance, \"Parasite\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption\" are multiple award-winning films that the API suggests. Let me know if you'd like more information on any specific award-winning film or if you'd like a list of award-winning films.\n\nSecondly, I can help you identify and extract the names of award-winning filmmakers and industry professionals in the 'film festival' category. The API provides detailed information about the films, their crew members, and the awards they have won. For example, Quentin Tarantino and Ava DuVernay are filmmakers with numerous awards, and they are often invited as judges in film festivals. Industry professionals such as festival directors, jury members, and producers are also recognized for their contributions to the film industry at various film festivals. Let me know if you'd like more information on any specific individual or film or if you'd like a list of award-winning filmmakers and industry professionals in a particular film festival.\n\nRegarding the third subtask, the user requested a streaming link for a YouTube video with the ID 'UxxajLWwzqY'. However, I could not find a direct streaming link for the video in the API response. The API did suggest a link to the video on all music platforms, but it does not directly lead to the video. I recommend checking the video description for further information on how to stream the video or visiting the artists' social media pages.\n\nI hope this self-consistent final answer helps you in organizing your film festival and answers all the subtasks related to your question. Let me know if you have any additional queries!",

I have searched for videos related to the keyword 'drama' on YouTube and found two videos. The first video is titled \"aespa 에스파 'Drama' MV\" uploaded by the channel SMTOWN one month ago. It has received over 74 million views and its duration is 3 minutes and 48 seconds. The thumbnail image for the video is also available. The second video was uploaded 12 hours ago, but the URL was incomplete in the response, so I couldn't provide additional information for that video.\n\n2. I have searched for the YouTube video with ID 'UxxajLWwzqY' and couldn't find a streaming link directly from the API response. However, you can search for the streaming link on websites that allow users to find YouTube streaming links, such as keepvid.com or youtube-dl.org. Remember to ensure that you are accessing these websites in accordance with their terms of use and YouTube's terms of service.\n\n3. I have used IMDb to find people in the acting category and have made a list of their names.

The first video is titled \"aespa 에스파 'Drama' MV\" uploaded by the channel SMTOWN one month ago. It has received over 74 million views and its duration is 3 minutes and 48 seconds. The thumbnail image for the video is also available. The second video was uploaded 12 hours ago, but the URL was incomplete in the response, so I couldn't provide additional information for that video.\n\n2. I have searched for the YouTube video with ID 'UxxajLWwzqY' and couldn't find a streaming link directly from the API response. However, you can search for the streaming link on websites that allow users to find YouTube streaming links, such as keepvid.com or youtube-dl.org. Remember to ensure that you are accessing these websites in accordance with their terms of use and YouTube's terms of service.\n\n3. I have used IMDb to find people in the acting category and have made a list of their names. Here's a list of their names: Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Leonardo DiCaprio, Emma Watson, Denzel Washington, Viola Davis, Cate Blanchett, Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, Eddie Murphy.

Use a URL shortener tool like Bitly to generate short URLs for each digital invitation. To do this, sign up for a free Bitly account, paste the URL of your digital invitation into the \"Long URL\" field, click \"Shorten,\" and copy the generated shortened URL. Repeat this process for each digital invitation.\n\n2. If you'd like to choose a custom domain for your short links, check with the specific URL shortener service you intend to use to see if they offer a list of available domains or custom domains. Some popular URL shortener services, like Bitly, offer customizable domains, so you can create short links with a personalized domain name.\n\n3. Here are some suggestions for customizable domain names for your anniversary party invitations using Bitly:\n   - bit.ly/anniversaryinvite\n   - bit.ly/couplenameanniversary\n   - bit.ly/partylocationanniversary\n   - bit.ly/anniversaryRSVP\n\nChoose a name that is meaningful, easy to remember, and reflects the essence of your anniversary party.\n\nUsing a URL shortener tool like Bitly makes it easier to share long links on social media or in text messages without taking up too much space. Plus, with Bitly, you can track the number of clicks on each link.\n\nI hope this information helps you plan a successful surprise anniversary party with digital invitations and short, unique URLs.

For instance, here's a Python example using Google Client Library:\n\n```python\nfrom googleapiclient.discovery import build\n\n# Set up the API client\nyoutube = build('youtube', 'v3')\n\n# Set your keywords and other search parameters\nsearch_query = 'travel Italy'\npart = 'snippet'\nmax_results = 10\n\n# Make the search request\nresponse = youtube.search().list(\n    q=search_query,\n    part=part,\n    maxResults=max_results\n).execute()\n\n# Print the search results\nfor search_result in response.get('items', []):\n    print(f'Title: {search_result.get(\"snippet\").get(\"title\")}')\n    print(f'ID: {search_result.get(\"id\").get(\"videoId\")}')\n```\n\n2. Use a YouTube downloader tool to download the selected travel videos:\n   a. Download and install 4K Video Downloader (https://www.4kdownload.com/products/product-videodownloader).\n   b. Launch the software and paste the YouTube video link into the program.\n   c. Choose the desired video quality and format and click \"Download.\"\n   d.

These platforms offer a wealth of experimental films that often experiment with unconventional storytelling, visual styles, and production methods.\n\nFor instance, on Vimeo On Demand, you can find \"The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes\" by Stan Brakhage, an avant-garde masterpiece that uses various techniques like double exposure, scratching the film, and hand-painting to create a visual exploration with no narrative or dialogue. Another example is \"Leviathan\" by Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Verena Paravel on FilmFestivalSecrets, which immerses the viewer into the world of the commercial fishing industry using raw and extreme cinematography and mainly sound and visuals to tell the story.\n\nTo find more specific video titles and creators, you can search for keywords like \"experimental film,\" \"avant-garde cinema,\" or \"art house film,\" or search for the names of renowned avant-garde filmmakers on these platforms.\n\nOnce you have identified the videos you would like to download for offline analysis, you can use video downloader tools like KeepVid or 4K Video Downloader to download them. Make sure the videos are available for download and that you have the legal right to download and use them for offline analysis.\n\nTo download a video using KeepVid or 4K Video Downloader, go to the video's page on the platform, copy the video URL, install and launch the downloader tool, paste the video URL into the downloader tool, choose the desired video quality and format for download, and click the \"Download\" button to start the download process. Once the download is complete, you can find the downloaded video in the \"Downloads\" folder on your computer or in the designated download location set by your downloader tool.",

These platforms offer a wealth of experimental films that often experiment with unconventional storytelling, visual styles, and production methods.\n\nFor instance, on Vimeo On Demand, you can find \"The Act of Seeing with One's Own Eyes\" by Stan Brakhage, an avant-garde masterpiece that uses various techniques like double exposure, scratching the film, and hand-painting to create a visual exploration with no narrative or dialogue. Another example is \"Leviathan\" by Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Verena Paravel on FilmFestivalSecrets, which immerses the viewer into the world of the commercial fishing industry using raw and extreme cinematography and mainly sound and visuals to tell the story.\n\nTo find more specific video titles and creators, you can search for keywords like \"experimental film,\" \"avant-garde cinema,\" or \"art house film,\" or search for the names of renowned avant-garde filmmakers on these platforms.\n\nOnce you have identified the videos you would like to download for offline analysis, you can use video downloader tools like KeepVid or 4K Video Downloader to download them. Make sure the videos are available for download and that you have the legal right to download and use them for offline analysis.\n\nTo download a video using KeepVid or 4K Video Downloader, go to the video's page on the platform, copy the video URL, install and launch the downloader tool, paste the video URL into the downloader tool, choose the desired video quality and format for download, and click the \"Download\" button to start the download process. Once the download is complete, you can find the downloaded video in the \"Downloads\" folder on your computer or in the designated download location set by your downloader tool.\"\n}",

These categories include Romantic Comedy, Slapstick Comedy, Satire Comedy, Sitcom, and Splatstick.\n\nSecondly, I have searched for information about the Paramount Pictures channel on SchedulesDirect and found that it is available on Paramount Plus, which is a media streaming service. To access Paramount Pictures content on Paramount Plus, you will need to subscribe to the service. Paramount Plus is offered by several media streaming guides, including SchedulesDirect, but the specific instructions for accessing Paramount Plus through SchedulesDirect may vary. The API response also lists several other media streaming services where Paramount Pictures content may be available.\n\nThirdly, I have attempted to find comments for a video with ID '123456' on a video streaming or downloading platform, but I was unable to determine which platform the user had in mind. I suggest checking the websites or apps of popular video streaming platforms, such as YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies, or Apple TV Plus, for the video and if they provide a comments section for users to leave feedback.\n\nLastly, I have identified that the ID 'UxxajLWwzqY' does not correspond to a movie but rather to a music video titled \"Icona Pop - I Love It (feat. Charli XCX) [OFFICIAL VIDEO]\" by the artist Icona Pop. The video is available on YouTube, and you can find it on the channel \"Icona Pop\" with the channel ID 'UC7spdtNtUXp1xVdUS1M2Mxg'.\n\nIf you have any further questions or require assistance with any other subtasks, please let me know.",

These categories include Romantic Comedy, Slapstick Comedy, Satire Comedy, Sitcom, and Splatstick.\n\nSecondly, I have searched for information about the Paramount Pictures channel on SchedulesDirect and found that it is available on Paramount Plus, which is a media streaming service. To access Paramount Pictures content on Paramount Plus, you will need to subscribe to the service. Paramount Plus is offered by several media streaming guides, including SchedulesDirect, but the specific instructions for accessing Paramount Plus through SchedulesDirect may vary. The API response also lists several other media streaming services where Paramount Pictures content may be available.\n\nThirdly, I have attempted to find comments for a video with ID '123456' on a video streaming or downloading platform, but I was unable to determine which platform the user had in mind. I suggest checking the websites or apps of popular video streaming platforms, such as YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies, or Apple TV Plus, for the video and if they provide a comments section for users to leave feedback.\n\nLastly, I have identified that the ID 'UxxajLWwzqY' does not correspond to a movie but rather to a music video titled \"Icona Pop - I Love It (feat. Charli XCX) [OFFICIAL VIDEO]\" by the artist Icona Pop. The video is available on YouTube, and you can find it on the channel \"Icona Pop\" with the channel ID 'UC7spdtNtUXp1xVdUS1M2Mxg'.\n\nIf you have any further questions or require assistance with any other subtasks, please let me know.\"\n}",

Here are the answers to the subtasks you've provided:\n\nFirst, I've searched for information on the 'photography' category on Wikipedia. According to Wikipedia, photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation. It has many applications, including art, science, research, recording history, and mass communication. If you're interested in learning more about the history of photography, different types of photography, or techniques and equipment used in photography, I encourage you to explore the Wikipedia page on photography further. You can access it by visiting the following link: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography>.\n\nSecond, I've searched for details about the National Geographic channel on their official website. The National Geographic channel is known for its high-quality documentaries and programming focused on nature, science, and culture. Their official website is www.natgeotv.com, and it provides various features such as watching live TV, browsing shows, and accessing exclusive content.\n\nThird, I've searched for information about the video with ID '901234' on National Geographic's YouTube channel. However, the API response did not provide specific details about the video, such as the title, description, or release date. To obtain that information, you can visit the video page on YouTube directly by searching for \"National Geographic 901234\" in the YouTube search bar. Once you're on the video page, you'll be able to see the title, description, and other relevant details about the video.\n\nLastly, I've searched for a tutorial video on wildlife photography with the ID 'UxxajLWwzqY' on a video sharing platform like YouTube or Vimeo. However, the API response indicated that the video with that ID is a music video with a different title and description. If you could please provide the correct ID for the wildlife photography tutorial video, I'd be happy to help you find it.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

I searched for books in the category you specified and identified a fantasy and adventure story for children or teenagers titled \"The Brightest Night\" by Tui T. The book has a page count of 308, was published in 2014, and falls under the subcategories of Adventure stories (Children's / Teenage), General fiction (Children's / Teenage), and Fantasy & magical realism (Children's / Teenage). The specific ISBNs for this book are 9781496583499, 9781484778715, and 9781496565549.\n2. I also searched for a book titled \"Book Riot,\" but the results did not match your category criteria. Instead, I found a non-fiction book about the history of riot control vehicles. This book, published by Osprey Publishing, is written by Chris McNab and covers the history and development of riot control vehicles from 1945 to the present day.\n3. Unfortunately, I was unable to find comments for the video with ID \"234567\" due to a missing 'videoId' parameter in the API request. To retrieve comments for a specific video using the YouTube Data API, you need to include the video ID as a parameter in the API request.\n4. In regards to your question about streaming or downloading the audiobook with ID \"UxxajLWwzqY,\" it appears that this ID corresponds to a music video on YouTube with the title \"Icona Pop - I Love It (feat. Charli XCX)\". I could not find an audiobook with this ID through the provided API response or Google.\n5. If you're looking for free audiobooks and your Google search returns multiple results, I recommend checking out LibriVox and Open Culture. Both are reputable sources for free audiobooks, with LibriVox being a volunteer-driven project that records and distributes books in the public domain, and Open Culture being an educational media and technology initiative that provides access to a vast collection of free cultural and educational media.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you in organizing your virtual book club!

It charts how the vehicles have evolved in terms of technology and layout, and also details how the associated weapon systems have been refined over time, from water cannon and tear gas launchers to sub-sonic sound waves and microwave energy. The operational history of the vehicles is explained in the dramatic context of major incidents across the world, from the streets of Northern Ireland and Eastern Europe to the favelas of Brazil and battlegrounds of Iraq.\", 'img_link': 'https://library.lol/covers/1403000/7f5987b4571fae13f4dcf8c"

Based on the API response, here are some examples of available domains:\n\n1. example.com\n2. newdomain.net\n3. shorturl.org\n4. tiny.com\n5. urlshort.io\n\nPlease keep in mind that availability may change over time, so it's always a good idea to double-check before registering a domain name. If you have a specific domain in mind, please let me know and I'll be happy to check if it's available based on the API response.\n\nNext, I can help you create a short URL for the party invitation using a URL shortening tool. Here are some popular options:\n\n1. Bitly: Go to bitly.com, paste your long URL in the text box, and click \"Shorten\".\n2. TinyURL: Go to tinyurl.com, paste your long URL in the text box, and click \"Make TinyURL!\".\n3. Goo.gl: If you have a Google account, go to goo.gl, sign in, paste your long URL in the text box, and click \"Shorten\".\n\nOnce you have shortened the URL, feel free to share it with your guests for the party invitation.\n\nFinally, to increase visibility and engagement for your party event on social media, I can suggest some unique and catchy hashtags using a social media trending tool. Here are some examples:\n\n1. #gmj - With a total of 27,383 posts\n2. #skyisyourlimit - With a total of 2,538 posts\n3. #rosarioklassics - With a total of 2,585 posts\n4. #scopare - With a total of 7,722 posts\n5. #medoogalanta - With a total of 1,923 posts\n\nFeel free to use these hashtags in your party-related posts on social media.

Based on the API response, here are some examples of available domains:\n\n1. example.com\n2. newdomain.net\n3. shorturl.org\n4. tiny.com\n5. urlshort.io\n\nPlease keep in mind that availability may change over time, so it's always a good idea to double-check before registering a domain name. If you have a specific domain in mind, please let me know and I'll be happy to check if it's available based on the API response.\n\nNext, I can help you create a short URL for the party invitation using a URL shortening tool. Here are some popular options:\n\n1. Bitly: Go to bitly.com, paste your long URL in the text box, and click \"Shorten\".\n2. TinyURL: Go to tinyurl.com, paste your long URL in the text box, and click \"Make TinyURL!\".\n3. Goo.gl: If you have a Google account, go to goo.gl, sign in, paste your long URL in the text box, and click \"Shorten\".\n\nOnce you have shortened the URL, feel free to share it with your guests for the party invitation.\n\nFinally, to increase visibility and engagement for your party event on social media, I can suggest some unique and catchy hashtags using a social media trending tool. Here are some examples:\n\n1. #gmj - With a total of 27,383 posts\n2. #skyisyourlimit - With a total of 2,538 posts\n3. #rosarioklassics - With a total of 2,585 posts\n4. #scopare - With a total of 7,722 posts\n5. #medoogalanta - With a total of 1,923 posts\n\nFeel free to use these hashtags in your party-related posts on social media. You can also explore the links provided in the response to discover more popular hashtags related to your party theme or event.\n\nLet me know if you need help with anything else!\"\n}",

Search for the YouTube video using its title or keywords by making a request to the YouTube Data API v3 with the required \"query\" parameter. For example: `https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&q=Star+Wars+trailer&key=YOUR_API_KEY`. Replace \"Star Wars trailer\" with the title or keywords for the YouTube video you want to search for and \"YOUR_API_KEY\" with your actual API key.\n\n2. Once you have the video ID, make a request to the YouTube Data API to get the video's details, including its title, description, and length: `https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?id=VIDEO_ID&part=snippet&key=YOUR_API_KEY`. Replace \"VIDEO_ID\" with the unique ID of the YouTube video you want to access the description for, and \"YOUR_API_KEY\" with your actual API key.\n\n3. To download the YouTube video, use a third-party YouTube video downloader tool such as 4K Video Downloader, SaveFrom.net, or KeepVid. These tools will allow you to download the video file and save it to your device. Be aware that downloading YouTube videos without the permission of the video owner may be against YouTube's terms of service and copyright law.\n\n4. To extract the video title from the downloaded file, you can try looking for it in the file name, or use a media player or specialized tool to extract the metadata from the file.\n\n5. To determine the length of the video, check its metadata or properties using media players or file explorers.\n\n6. To find related tags for the 'Education' category on YouTube, search for videos using the YouTube Data API and look for the following tags: \"Learning\", \"Online courses\", \"Tutorial\", \"University\", \"Student\", \"School\", \"Educational\", \"Academic\", \"Lesson\", \"Homework help\", \"Study\", and \"Test prep\". These tags can help users find content related to various educational topics and learning resources on YouTube.",

Search for the YouTube video using its title or keywords by making a request to the YouTube Data API v3 with the required \"query\" parameter. For example: `https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet&q=Star+Wars+trailer&key=YOUR_API_KEY`. Replace \"Star Wars trailer\" with the title or keywords for the YouTube video you want to search for and \"YOUR_API_KEY\" with your actual API key.\n\n2. Once you have the video ID, make a request to the YouTube Data API to get the video's details, including its title, description, and length: `https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?id=VIDEO_ID&part=snippet&key=YOUR_API_KEY`. Replace \"VIDEO_ID\" with the unique ID of the YouTube video you want to access the description for, and \"YOUR_API_KEY\" with your actual API key.\n\n3. To download the YouTube video, use a third-party YouTube video downloader tool such as 4K Video Downloader, SaveFrom.net, or KeepVid. These tools will allow you to download the video file and save it to your device. Be aware that downloading YouTube videos without the permission of the video owner may be against YouTube's terms of service and copyright law.\n\n4. To extract the video title from the downloaded file, you can try looking for it in the file name, or use a media player or specialized tool to extract the metadata from the file.\n\n5. To determine the length of the video, check its metadata or properties using media players or file explorers.\n\n6. To find related tags for the 'Education' category on YouTube, search for videos using the YouTube Data API and look for the following tags: \"Learning\", \"Online courses\", \"Tutorial\", \"University\", \"Student\", \"School\", \"Educational\", \"Academic\", \"Lesson\", \"Homework help\", \"Study\", and \"Test prep\". These tags can help users find content related to various educational topics and learning resources on YouTube.\"\n}",

The results have been stored in a variable named 'godfather_media'. This variable contains a list of media items, each with details such as ID, title, type, year, and poster path. You can access individual media items using their index in the list. For example, `godfather_media[0]` would give you the details of the first result. If you wanted to filter the results to only include movies, you could use a list comprehension like `godfather_movies = [item for item in godfather_media if item[\"type\"] == \"movie\"]`.\n\nSecond, I used the 'movie database' tool to search for movies from India with the genre 'Bollywood'. The results have been stored in a variable named 'indian_movies'. This variable is a list of movies that match the search criteria. Each movie is represented by a dictionary containing details such as title, release year, poster image URL, and genre. For example, you can access the title and poster image URL of the first movie using `indian_movies[0][\"title\"]` and `indian_movies[0][\"poster_path\"]`, respectively.\n\nLastly, I used the 'movie database' API again to search for movies produced in the United States and filtered the results by the genre 'American'. The results have been stored in a variable named 'american_movies'. This variable is a list of movies that match the search criteria. Each movie is represented by a dictionary containing details such as title, release year, poster image URL, and genre. For example, you can access the title and poster image URL of the first movie using `american_movies[0][\"title\"]` and `american_movies[0][\"poster_path\"]`, respectively.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you need any more information or have any questions about the results.",

The results have been stored in a variable named 'godfather_media'. This variable contains a list of media items, each with details such as ID, title, type, year, and poster path. You can access individual media items using their index in the list. For example, `godfather_media[0]` would give you the details of the first result. If you wanted to filter the results to only include movies, you could use a list comprehension like `godfather_movies = [item for item in godfather_media if item[\"type\"] == \"movie\"]`.\n\nSecond, I used the 'movie database' tool to search for movies from India with the genre 'Bollywood'. The results have been stored in a variable named 'indian_movies'. This variable is a list of movies that match the search criteria. Each movie is represented by a dictionary containing details such as title, release year, poster image URL, and genre. For example, you can access the title and poster image URL of the first movie using `indian_movies[0][\"title\"]` and `indian_movies[0][\"poster_path\"]`, respectively.\n\nLastly, I used the 'movie database' API again to search for movies produced in the United States and filtered the results by the genre 'American'. The results have been stored in a variable named 'american_movies'. This variable is a list of movies that match the search criteria. Each movie is represented by a dictionary containing details such as title, release year, poster image URL, and genre. For example, you can access the title and poster image URL of the first movie using `american_movies[0][\"title\"]` and `american_movies[0][\"poster_path\"]`, respectively.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you need any more information or have any questions about the results.\"\n}",

Use their domain name search functionality to enter keywords related to your party theme or name, and then filter the results based on your preferences, such as domain extension and price. Once you find a domain name you like, you can proceed to register it through the domain registration service.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to use Namecheap to find available domains:\n\n1. Go to Namecheap's website (<https://www.namecheap.com/>) and sign in to your account or create a new one if you don't have one.\n2. In the top menu, click on \"Domains\" and then select \"Domain Name Search.\"\n3. In the search bar, enter the desired domain name or keyword, and then click the magnifying glass icon or press Enter on your keyboard.\n4. Filter your results by extension (such as .com, .net, .org, etc.) or by price, length, or other criteria using the available filters on the left-hand side of the page.\n5. Once you've found a domain name you like, click on it to view more details and proceed with the registration process.\n\nI hope this information helps you plan and execute your surprise party invitation effectively.

Use their domain name search functionality to enter keywords related to your party theme or name, and then filter the results based on your preferences, such as domain extension and price. Once you find a domain name you like, you can proceed to register it through the domain registration service.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to use Namecheap to find available domains:\n\n1. Go to Namecheap's website (<https://www.namecheap.com/>) and sign in to your account or create a new one if you don't have one.\n2. In the top menu, click on \"Domains\" and then select \"Domain Name Search.\"\n3. In the search bar, enter the desired domain name or keyword, and then click the magnifying glass icon or press Enter on your keyboard.\n4. Filter your results by extension (such as .com, .net, .org, etc.) or by price, length, or other criteria using the available filters on the left-hand side of the page.\n5. Once you've found a domain name you like, click on it to view more details and proceed with the registration process.\n\nI hope this information helps you plan and execute your surprise party invitation effectively. Let me know if you have any further questions or need clarification on any of the steps.\"\n}",

Obtain an API key for Bitly by signing up for an account on their website if you don't already have one. You can find your API key in the \"Settings\" section of your account dashboard.\n2. Choose a travel-themed domain name using a domain registration API or service. Here are some suggestions: TravelSite.com, WanderlustVibes.com, JetSetLife.net, AdventureAwaits.org, or VacationHQ.net. Keep in mind that availability of these domain names may change, so it's best to check the registration API or service directly for the most up-to-date information.\n3. Generate a shortened URL for your itinerary using the Bitly API. Make an HTTP request to the API endpoint with your API key included in the request headers, and include the long URL of your itinerary in the request body. Here's an example of how to make such a request using cURL:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  'https://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/shorten' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\"long_url\": \"https://example.com/your-long-url\"}' | jq -r '.bitly.short_url'\n```\n\nReplace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key, and replace `https://example.com/your-long-url` with the long URL of your itinerary. The response from the API will include the shortened URL, which you can extract from the JSON response using a tool like `jq`. This command will output the shortened URL as a string, which you can then use with your travel-themed domain name.\n\nFor example, if you register the domain name WanderlustVibes.com, you can create a subdomain like itinerary.wanderlustvibes.com, and use the shortened URL as the content of that subdomain. This way, when you share the URL itinerary.wanderlustvibes.com with your family, they will be taken directly to the shortened version of your itinerary.",

Choose a domain name for your workshop that reflects its purpose by considering its name, theme, primary focus, target audience, and industry or niche. You can use domain name registration services or marketplaces like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, Name.com, or 1&1 IONOS to search for and register an available domain name that suits your event.\n5. Register the domain name and connect it to the website or landing page where you will post the event details by updating the DNS records to point to your website or landing page using your domain registrar's control panel.\n6.

Obtain an API key for the URL shortening service, such as Bitly, if you don't already have one by signing up for an account and following the instructions provided by the API documentation.\n2. Access the API documentation for the URL shortening service to understand how to create a short URL by making an API request with the event link as a parameter.\n3. Create the short URL for your event using the API and save it by copying and pasting the shortened URL into a document, text file, or other storage location.\n4. Choose a domain name for your workshop that reflects its purpose by considering its name, theme, primary focus, target audience, and industry or niche. You can use domain name registration services or marketplaces like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, Name.com, or 1&1 IONOS to search for and register an available domain name that suits your event.\n5. Register the domain name and connect it to the website or landing page where you will post the event details by updating the DNS records to point to your website or landing page using your domain registrar's control panel.\n6. Use a URL shortening service like Bitly or a similar service to create a short URL for your event by entering the long URL of your event in the text box, clicking on the \"Shorten\" or \"Generate\" button, and copying or downloading the short URL to use it for your event promotion.\"\n}",

Based on your request, I've found several romantic movies that are currently available for streaming on Netflix. Here are some titles you might be interested in:\n\n1. The Irishman - This epic crime drama tells the story of Frank Sheeran, a truck driver who becomes an associate of the Bufalino crime family. With a star-studded cast including Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci, this movie is sure to be an engaging and romantic choice.\n2. The Half of It - This romantic comedy follows Ellie Chu, a shy, introverted high school student who is hired by popular jock Paul Munsky to write love letters to the girls he likes. This heartwarming movie is a great choice for a romantic night in.\n3. To All the Boys I've Loved Before - This romantic comedy tells the story of Lara Jean Covey, who writes secret love letters to all of her past crushes, only to have them all suddenly kissed by the recipients. This movie features charming and relatable characters, making it a must-watch for a romantic date night.\n4. The Princess Switch: Switched Again - This romantic comedy follows dueling princesses Margaret and Stacy, who, after accidentally switching places, decide to help each other in their respective relationships. With its fairytale setting and heartwarming storyline, this movie is sure to provide a romantic and magical experience.\n5. Holidate - This romantic comedy follows two strangers, Sloane and Jackson, who make a pact to be each other's plus-ones at every holiday event they attend that year. This movie is a great choice for a romantic date night during the holiday season.\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to find any romantic movies currently available for streaming on Prime Video due to an API error. I recommend checking their website or app directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information on their streaming offerings.\n\nAs for dinner ideas, I'd be happy to help you draw inspiration from the movies I previously mentioned. Here are some suggestions based on the scenes in the movies:\n\n1. The Irishman - You could make some classic Italian dishes, such as lasagna, spaghetti Bolognese, or chicken parmigiana, to create a romantic dinner reminiscent of the scene in \"The Irishman\" where Frank Sheeran takes a date out for a nice meal at a fancy Italian restaurant.\n2. The Half of It - In the movie, Ellie Chu cooks a heartfelt meal for her crush. You could try making a simple yet heartfelt meal, like grilled cheese sandwiches or a pasta dish with tomato sauce and fresh basil.\n3. To All the Boys I've Loved Before - The movie includes scenes where the characters share meals together, such as dumplings and noodles. You could try making some Chinese or Asian-inspired dishes, like dumplings, stir-fry, or sushi.\n4. The Princess Switch: Switched Again - In the movie, the characters enjoy a fancy dinner at a palace. You could try making a more elaborate and elegant meal, like coq au vin, beef Wellington, or a seafood paella, to create a romantic and sophisticated dining experience.\n\nI hope these suggestions inspire you to create a romantic dinner for you and your significant other.

These playlists typically feature the latest and greatest hits across various genres.\n\nTo check the streaming availability of songs on Spotify and Apple Music, you can use the API endpoints provided by each platform. For Spotify, you can use the \"search\" endpoint to search for songs by artist, album, or track name, and for Apple Music, you can use the \"nowPlaying\" endpoint to search for songs by artist, album, or track name. Make sure to include the access token in the request headers to authenticate your API requests.\n\nAs for snacks, we suggest checking out popular themes such as American, Asian, and European cuisine. For American-themed snacks, you could try classic options like chips and dip, burgers, and hot dogs. For Asian-themed snacks, you could try dishes like sushi, spring rolls, and dumplings. For European-themed snacks, you could try options like cheese and crackers, baked goods, and olives.\n\nIt's important to note that the availability and popularity of these snacks can vary depending on factors such as location, personal preferences, and dietary restrictions.
