To get started, you'll need to sign up for a Bitly account and obtain an API key. Once you have your API key, you can use it to make API calls to generate short links for your event details.\n\nHere's an example API call you can use to generate a short link for your event details:\n```bash\nhttps://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/links\nPOST <https://api.bitly.com/v4/links>\nContent-Type: application/json\nAuthorization: Basic API_KEY\n\n{\n  \"link\": \"my_long_url_for_event_details\",\n  \"domain_name\": \"bitly.com\",\n  \"short_url\": \"my_short_url_for_event_details\"\n}\n```\nIn this API call, you'll need to replace `API_KEY` with your actual Bitly API key. You'll also need to replace `my_long_url_for_event_details` with the URL of your event details, and `my_short_url_for_event_details` with the desired short URL for your event details.\n\nThe API will return a JSON object containing the short link for your event details. You can then use this short link to share your event details with others.\n\nTo create branded short links for the event website using the URL Link Shortener tool, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the URL Link Shortener tool website and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.\n2. Once you have an account, navigate to the \"Shorten URLs\" section and click on \"Create Shortened URL.\"\n3. In the \"Create Shortened URL\" dialog box, you can customize the link by entering the desired link text and URL. You can also choose to enable the \"Branded Tagger\" feature to add your company name or logo to the shortened link.\n4. Click on \"Create Shortened URL\" to create the branded short link for your event website.\n\nOnce you have generated short URLs for the event details and created branded short links for the event website, you can promote the event on social media using the event hashtag #PinkRibbonWalk. You can share the short links on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to encourage people to learn more about the event and make donations to support the cause. Additionally, you can use the branded short links to track clicks and measure the effectiveness of your social media campaign.",

To get started, you'll need to sign up for a Bitly account and obtain an API key. Once you have your API key, you can use it to make API calls to generate short links for your event details.\n\nHere's an example API call you can use to generate a short link for your event details:\n```bash\nhttps://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/links\nPOST <https://api.bitly.com/v4/links>\nContent-Type: application/json\nAuthorization: Basic API_KEY\n\n{\n  \"link\": \"my_long_url_for_event_details\",\n  \"domain_name\": \"bitly.com\",\n  \"short_url\": \"my_short_url_for_event_details\"\n}\n```\nIn this API call, you'll need to replace `API_KEY` with your actual Bitly API key. You'll also need to replace `my_long_url_for_event_details` with the URL of your event details, and `my_short_url_for_event_details` with the desired short URL for your event details.\n\nThe API will return a JSON object containing the short link for your event details. You can then use this short link to share your event details with others.\n\nTo create branded short links for the event website using the URL Link Shortener tool, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the URL Link Shortener tool website and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.\n2. Once you have an account, navigate to the \"Shorten URLs\" section and click on \"Create Shortened URL.\"\n3. In the \"Create Shortened URL\" dialog box, you can customize the link by entering the desired link text and URL. You can also choose to enable the \"Branded Tagger\" feature to add your company name or logo to the shortened link.\n4. Click on \"Create Shortened URL\" to create the branded short link for your event website.\n\nOnce you have generated short URLs for the event details and created branded short links for the event website, you can promote the event on social media using the event hashtag #PinkRibbonWalk. You can share the short links on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to encourage people to learn more about the event and make donations to support the cause. Additionally, you can use the branded short links to track clicks and measure the effectiveness of your social media campaign.\"\n}",

Based on the API response, it appears that there are several options for selecting a domain for your invitations. The response lists several domains that have a significant number of backlinks and a domain inlink rank of 0 or higher. Some of the domains that are listed in the response include \"budgetmart.online\", \"pushpagiriyilcentralschool.com\", \"jeevasurgicals.com\", \"smch.edu.in\", \"magicianfrmichael.com\", \"jeevahomenursing.com\", and \"codester.com\". Each of these domains has a unique set of backlinks and a domain inlink rank, which may be useful in selecting the perfect domain for your invitations.\n\nIt's important to note that the domain inlink rank is a metric that measures the importance and relevance of a domain based on the number and quality of other domains that link back to it. Domains with a higher domain inlink rank are generally considered to be more authoritative and trustworthy, which may be important factors to consider when selecting a domain for your invitations. In addition to considering the domain inlink rank, you may also want to consider other factors such as the reputation of the domain, the relevance of the domain to your industry or niche, and the availability of the domain name. Ultimately, the best domain for your invitations will depend on your specific needs and goals, so it may be helpful to do additional research and testing to find the perfect domain.",

Based on the API response, it appears that there are several options for selecting a domain for your invitations. The response lists several domains that have a significant number of backlinks and a domain inlink rank of 0 or higher. Some of the domains that are listed in the response include \"budgetmart.online\", \"pushpagiriyilcentralschool.com\", \"jeevasurgicals.com\", \"smch.edu.in\", \"magicianfrmichael.com\", \"jeevahomenursing.com\", and \"codester.com\". Each of these domains has a unique set of backlinks and a domain inlink rank, which may be useful in selecting the perfect domain for your invitations.\n\nIt's important to note that the domain inlink rank is a metric that measures the importance and relevance of a domain based on the number and quality of other domains that link back to it. Domains with a higher domain inlink rank are generally considered to be more authoritative and trustworthy, which may be important factors to consider when selecting a domain for your invitations. In addition to considering the domain inlink rank, you may also want to consider other factors such as the reputation of the domain, the relevance of the domain to your industry or niche, and the availability of the domain name. Ultimately, the best domain for your invitations will depend on your specific needs and goals, so it may be helpful to do additional research and testing to find the perfect domain.\"\n}",

The genres include Action, Adventure, Animation, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Family, Fantasy, History, Horror, Music, Mystery, Romance, Science Fiction, TV Movie, Thriller, War, and Western.\n\nRegarding cast members, you can use an API to retrieve information about a specific cast member, such as their name, profession, birth and death years, and best titles. For example, John Smith is a 30-year-old male actor with a height of 180 cm, a weight of 75 kg, and brown hair and blue eyes. He was born on January 1st, 1992, and is an American national. John is currently single and does not have any children. He has a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Acting.\n\nWith this information, you can create fun and engaging movie trivia questions that test your family's knowledge of movies and their cast members.

Unfortunately, based on the API response, it seems that no fitness workout videos were found on YouTube. However, there are many other ways to find fitness workout videos online, such as searching for workout videos on different video-sharing platforms like Vimeo or Dailymotion, or searching for fitness workout channels on popular social media platforms like Instagram or TikTok. Additionally, the user can try using specific keywords when searching for workout videos to refine their search results.\n\nNext, we need to download the YTStream - Download YouTube Videos tool. Based on the API response, the YTStream - Download YouTube Videos tool appears to be a software program or application that allows users to download videos from YouTube in high definition (HD) quality and with fast download speeds. However, it is important to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions or licenses to use the videos for their intended purpose, and to check the video's settings before attempting to download it.\n\nFinally, we need to use the tool to download and stream fitness workout videos. To do this, the user can follow these steps: visit the YTStream - Download YouTube Videos tool website or launch the software program on their computer, enter the URL of the fitness workout video they want to download in the search bar provided by the tool, select the video they want to download and click the \"Download\" button, choose the desired resolution and quality of the video, and select the option to stream the video while it downloads. Once the download and streaming process is complete, the user can watch the fitness workout video on their computer or transfer it to another device for later viewing.\n\nIt is important to note that downloading and streaming fitness workout videos may be subject to copyright restrictions, so it is important to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions or licenses to use the videos for their intended purpose. Additionally, some videos on YouTube may be marked as private or unavailable for downloading, so it is important to check the video's settings before attempting to download it.",

The subtask for finding a popular drama series available for streaming in the US suggests that the series \"Rings of Power\" is currently the most popular one, although it is not available for live event and will be available on December 9th, 2023 at 2:00 PM.\n\nHowever, the subtask for recommending a series for the family gathering suggests that there are several comedy movies available for streaming in the US that would be appropriate for a family gathering. Some of the popular ones include \"Welcome To New York\", \"Raja Abroadiya\", \"Baa Baaa Black Sheep\", \"Shaadi Teri Bajayenge Hum Band\", \"Nanu Ki Jaanu\", \"102 Not Out\", \"Falooda\", \"High Jack\", \"Khajoor Pe Atke\", \"When Obama Loved Osama\", \"Karwaan\", and \"Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi\".\n\nThe subtask for checking if \"Stranger Things\" is available for streaming in the US suggests that it is not available, but it is available for streaming in other countries such as India, Canada, and Australia. However, the subtask for providing streaming sources for \"Stranger Things\" suggests that it is not available for streaming in the US, and it may be possible to access it using a VPN from a different country.\n\nOverall, the family gathering can consider watching \"Rings of Power\" once it becomes available on December 9th, 2023 at 2:00 PM or they can choose from the list of comedy movies that are available for streaming in the US. If they are interested in watching \"Stranger Things,\" they can consider using a VPN to access it from a different country.",

The subtask for finding a popular drama series available for streaming in the US suggests that the series \"Rings of Power\" is currently the most popular one, although it is not available for live event and will be available on December 9th, 2023 at 2:00 PM.\n\nHowever, the subtask for recommending a series for the family gathering suggests that there are several comedy movies available for streaming in the US that would be appropriate for a family gathering. Some of the popular ones include \"Welcome To New York\", \"Raja Abroadiya\", \"Baa Baaa Black Sheep\", \"Shaadi Teri Bajayenge Hum Band\", \"Nanu Ki Jaanu\", \"102 Not Out\", \"Falooda\", \"High Jack\", \"Khajoor Pe Atke\", \"When Obama Loved Osama\", \"Karwaan\", and \"Happy Phirr Bhag Jayegi\".\n\nThe subtask for checking if \"Stranger Things\" is available for streaming in the US suggests that it is not available, but it is available for streaming in other countries such as India, Canada, and Australia. However, the subtask for providing streaming sources for \"Stranger Things\" suggests that it is not available for streaming in the US, and it may be possible to access it using a VPN from a different country.\n\nOverall, the family gathering can consider watching \"Rings of Power\" once it becomes available on December 9th, 2023 at 2:00 PM or they can choose from the list of comedy movies that are available for streaming in the US. If they are interested in watching \"Stranger Things,\" they can consider using a VPN to access it from a different country.\"\n}",

As a result, they need to upgrade their plan to be able to make more requests. Additionally, the user has exceeded the rate limit per second for their plan, which means that they are making requests too quickly and need to slow down the rate at which they are making requests to avoid hitting the rate limit again.\n\nIn response to Task 2, the API response suggests that the user should check if the desired content is available on any of the following streaming sources: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, HBO Max, or Peacock. If the content is available on one of these streaming sources, the API response provides a link to the streaming source's website where the user can learn more about the content and potentially watch or listen to it. If the content is not available on any of these streaming sources, the API response suggests that the user may be able to find it on a different streaming source or by purchasing or renting it from a digital retailer.\n\nTherefore, to summarize, the API response provides recommendations for streaming sources where the user may be able to find popular movies that are available for streaming in Australia.

In the meantime, you may want to explore other options for finding romantic movies, such as using a search engine or checking out movie streaming services that offer a wider selection of movies. Some popular movie streaming services that you may want to consider include Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and HBO Max. These services often have a wide selection of movies, including many romantic movies, that you can stream online.\n\nAs for filtering the list of movies based on user preferences, it seems that the API response for Task 3 does not provide a list of movies based on user preferences like genre and IMDb rating.

            "final_answer": " To search for travel videos on popular video-sharing platforms, you can use the search function to look for keywords related to the type of travel you're interested in. You can also try using specific destinations or landmarks as keywords to find videos that were filmed in those locations. Additionally, you can look for channels or accounts that specialize in travel content. Many popular travel influencers and bloggers have YouTube channels or Vimeo accounts where they share their travel experiences, tips, and occasionally even entire travel vlogs. To download the videos for editing, you can use video downloader tools such as 4K Video Downloader, ClipConverter, and Video DownloadHelper. Copy the video URL and paste it into the video downloader tool. Most video downloader tools will allow you to choose the quality of the video you want to download, as well as the format and output file name. Once the videos are downloaded, you can organize them in a folder or on your desktop for easy access. Depending on the video editing software you are using, you may be able to import multiple videos at once or drag and drop the videos into the software. Organize the videos in the video editing software by creating a new project or video and arranging the downloaded videos in the order you want them to appear in the final video. Edit the videos in the video editing software, including adding transitions, effects, and text overlays, as well as trimming or merging videos as needed. Once you are satisfied with the edited video, export it in the desired format and quality. However, it's important to note that while video downloader tools can be a convenient way to save videos for editing, they may not always work for all types of videos or on all video-sharing platforms. Some videos may be protected by copyright or other restrictions that prevent them from being downloaded, and some video-sharing platforms may have their own policies prohibiting video downloads.",

You can also try using specific destinations or landmarks as keywords to find videos that were filmed in those locations. Additionally, you can look for channels or accounts that specialize in travel content. Many popular travel influencers and bloggers have YouTube channels or Vimeo accounts where they share their travel experiences, tips, and occasionally even entire travel vlogs. To download the videos for editing, you can use video downloader tools such as 4K Video Downloader, ClipConverter, and Video DownloadHelper. Copy the video URL and paste it into the video downloader tool. Most video downloader tools will allow you to choose the quality of the video you want to download, as well as the format and output file name. Once the videos are downloaded, you can organize them in a folder or on your desktop for easy access. Depending on the video editing software you are using, you may be able to import multiple videos at once or drag and drop the videos into the software. Organize the videos in the video editing software by creating a new project or video and arranging the downloaded videos in the order you want them to appear in the final video. Edit the videos in the video editing software, including adding transitions, effects, and text overlays, as well as trimming or merging videos as needed. Once you are satisfied with the edited video, export it in the desired format and quality. However, it's important to note that while video downloader tools can be a convenient way to save videos for editing, they may not always work for all types of videos or on all video-sharing platforms. Some videos may be protected by copyright or other restrictions that prevent them from being downloaded, and some video-sharing platforms may have their own policies prohibiting video downloads.\"\n}",

You can sort the results by popularity or uniqueness to find the best slashtags for your party event.\n* Once you've found some slashtags that you like, you can copy and paste them into your social media posts or other promotional materials for your party event.\n1. Provide a list of available domains to choose from for the short URL using domain.me.

Simply go to their website, enter the long URL you want to shorten, and they will generate a shorter URL that is easier to remember and share. For example, if your long URL for the party invitation is <https://www.example.com/party-invitation>, you could use bit.ly to shorten it to <https://bit.ly/party-invitation>.\n\nTo suggest unique and memorable slashtags for the event, you can use tools like Hashtagify or CrowdRiff. Simply enter the name of your event in the search bar, and the platform will suggest a list of popular and relevant hashtags for your event. You can also try to come up with your own hashtags that are unique and relevant to your event. Some tips for creating unique and memorable hashtags include using words or phrases that are specific to your event, using emojis or symbols to make the hashtag more memorable, and avoiding overly common or generic hashtags.\n\nAs for the list of available domains to choose from, the API tool you are using does not have a function called \"domain\\_availability.\" However, you can try using a different API tool or platform that is capable of searching for domain availability. Some popular platforms for domain name search include Namecheap and GoDaddy. These platforms allow you to search for available domain names based on your desired keywords or phrases, and provide information on whether the domain is available for registration.\n\nI hope this helps!

Simply go to their website, enter the long URL you want to shorten, and they will generate a shorter URL that is easier to remember and share. For example, if your long URL for the party invitation is <https://www.example.com/party-invitation>, you could use bit.ly to shorten it to <https://bit.ly/party-invitation>.\n\nTo suggest unique and memorable slashtags for the event, you can use tools like Hashtagify or CrowdRiff. Simply enter the name of your event in the search bar, and the platform will suggest a list of popular and relevant hashtags for your event. You can also try to come up with your own hashtags that are unique and relevant to your event. Some tips for creating unique and memorable hashtags include using words or phrases that are specific to your event, using emojis or symbols to make the hashtag more memorable, and avoiding overly common or generic hashtags.\n\nAs for the list of available domains to choose from, the API tool you are using does not have a function called \"domain\\_availability.\" However, you can try using a different API tool or platform that is capable of searching for domain availability. Some popular platforms for domain name search include Namecheap and GoDaddy. These platforms allow you to search for available domain names based on your desired keywords or phrases, and provide information on whether the domain is available for registration.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\"\n}",

However, the API response is not providing the necessary information to create a short URL. The error message indicates that the access token is missing, which is required for authentication. Please make sure to include the access token in your API request to obtain the necessary information.\n\nFor the domain name for the team building link, you can use a domain name generator like DomCop or NameMesh. However, the API tool is unable to find the functions \"dns,\" \"keyword\\_search,\" and \"whois\" in the specified Python file path. To resolve this issue, you can try double-checking the file path provided in the response to ensure it is correct, checking if the functions are present in the specified Python file path, and verifying that the module name in the API response is correct and matches the actual module name in the Python file.\n\nOnce the issue is resolved, you can use the domain name generator tool to choose a domain name for the team building link.\n\nLastly, to provide a list of available domains for branding the short link, you can use a domain name generator like DomCop or NameMesh. The API tool is also unable to find the functions \"dns,\" \"keyword\\_search,\" and \"whois\" in the specified Python file path. To resolve this issue, you can follow the same steps as mentioned above.\n\nOnce the issue is resolved, you can use the domain name generator tool to get a list of available domains for branding the short link.",

Here's a self-consistent final answer to your question:\n\nTo generate a short URL for your sister's surprise graduation party, you can use a service called \"TinyURL\" to create a shortened URL that will redirect to the original URL. To do this, simply go to TinyURL's website (<https://tinypaste.com>) and enter the URL of your party invitation in the \"Paste your URL\" field. Then, click on the \"Shorten\" button to create the short URL.\n\nTo suggest fun and unique slashtags for the event, you can use an online hashtag generator tool to find popular and relevant hashtags related to events or come up with your own unique hashtag that represents your event. Make sure to choose hashtags that are relevant and appropriate for your event to attract the right audience and increase engagement.\n\nAs for available domains to choose from, the API tool does not have a function named \"whois\" or \"domain\\_search\" to execute this task. It is recommended to check the API documentation or contact the API provider for more information on how to obtain the list of available domains. Alternatively, you can use a third-party URL shortener or search for available domains on a domain registrar website.",

To do this, simply go to TinyURL's website (<https://tinypaste.com>) and enter the URL of your party invitation in the \"Paste your URL\" field. Then, click on the \"Shorten\" button to create the short URL.\n\nTo suggest fun and unique slashtags for the event, you can use an online hashtag generator tool to find popular and relevant hashtags related to events or come up with your own unique hashtag that represents your event. Make sure to choose hashtags that are relevant and appropriate for your event to attract the right audience and increase engagement.\n\nAs for available domains to choose from, the API tool does not have a function named \"whois\" or \"domain\\_search\" to execute this task. It is recommended to check the API documentation or contact the API provider for more information on how to obtain the list of available domains. Alternatively, you can use a third-party URL shortener or search for available domains on a domain registrar website.\"\n}",

This link is \"<https://go.evvnt.com/1098934>\". You can use this link to promote the event on social media.\n\nIn terms of promoting the short link on social media, there are several ways to do this. You can include the link in the event description and encourage people to click on it to learn more about the event. You can also share the link on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. When sharing the link on social media, be sure to include a compelling message that encourages people to support the charity event.\n\nRegarding Task 3, it seems that the API response did not provide information on how to gather statistics on the impact of URL shorteners on fundraising campaigns. However, URL shorteners can be useful tools for promoting events on social media. By using a short link, you can make it easier for people to share the event with their friends and followers. Additionally, some URL shorteners provide analytics that can help you track the performance of your event's link.\n\nOverall, while the API response did not provide all the information you were looking for, I hope this general information is helpful.

There are many URL shortener tools available online, both free and paid, such as Bitly, TinyURL, and Rebrandly. These tools work by taking a long URL as input and generating a shorter version of it, which can be easier to remember and share. When using a URL shortener tool, you can usually customize the shortened URL to include your own domain name or branding, which can help to increase brand awareness and credibility. Additionally, some URL shortener tools also offer analytics and tracking features, which can help you to monitor the performance of your shortened URLs and track clicks and conversions. Overall, using a URL shortener tool can be a great way to generate short links for your product pages.\n\nHowever, it seems that the API tool you are using does not have functions for checking domain availability, searching for available domains, or performing domain branding. The errors you received indicate that there are no functions named \"whois\", \"domain\\_search\", or \"domain\\_availability\" in the specified API files. To check if a domain is available for branding, you can try using a domain registrar tool or service. Many domain registrars offer tools that allow you to search for available domain names, check domain availability, and register a domain name. Some popular domain registrars include GoDaddy, Namecheap, and Google Domains. You can visit the website of any of these domain registrars and use their domain name search tools to find available domains that match your desired branding. Once you have found an available domain, you can then proceed to register it through the registrar's website.\n\nAs for analyzing click-through rates of different URL shorteners using a web analytics tool, it appears that the web analytics tool can provide information on click-through rates for different URL shorteners. However, the specific information that can be obtained through the tool may depend on the specific URL shortener being used and the specific analysis being conducted. To analyze click-through rates of different URL shorteners using a web analytics tool, you would need to first identify which URL shortener you want to analyze and then determine which metrics the tool provides for that particular URL shortener. You would then need to input the relevant URL or URLs into the tool and run the analysis. The specific information that can be obtained through the tool may vary, but it could potentially include metrics such as the number of clicks, click-through rate, conversion rate, and other relevant data. The tool may also provide visualizations or other types of insights to help you better understand the data and identify trends or patterns.",

Therefore, to filter the list of streaming sources based on availability in the US and Canada, you may need to look for alternative streaming platforms or check the availability of the movies on different platforms.

After analyzing the API response, we found that the movie \"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\" is available in English but not in Spanish. However, it is available for streaming in the US and Canada on various platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu.\n\nRegarding Task 2, the recommended movies are not available for streaming on any of the platforms mentioned in the previous answer. It seems that the recommended movies may not be available on streaming platforms in the US and Canada. Therefore, we recommend checking the official website of the movie theater or contacting the theater directly to inquire about the availability of the recommended movies for streaming. Alternatively, you can also try searching for the movies on different streaming platforms or renting or purchasing them on digital platforms such as iTunes, Google Play, or Amazon Prime Video.\n\nFor Task 3, the streaming sources for the recommended movies are not available in the US and Canada. Therefore, to filter the list of streaming sources based on availability in the US and Canada, you may need to look for alternative streaming platforms or check the availability of the movies on different platforms. You can also try searching for the movies on different streaming platforms or renting or purchasing them on digital platforms such as iTunes, Google Play, or Amazon Prime Video. However, it is important to note that the availability of movies on different platforms may vary, and it is recommended to check the availability of the movies on each platform before making a decision.\"\n}",

The subtasks and their answers are as follows:\n\n1. Task 1: Fetch the name of the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375'\nAnswer: The cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375' is none other than the talented actor, Chris Pratt.\n2. Task 2: Fetch the profession of the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375'\nAnswer: The profession of the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375' is not mentioned. However, we can infer from the previous answer that Chris Pratt is an actor, which is a profession in the entertainment industry.\n3. Task 3: Fetch the birth year of the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375'\nAnswer: To fetch the birth year of the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375', you can use the following code:\n```rust\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = '<https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/nm0000375?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY>'\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = json.loads(response.text)\n    birth_year = data['profile']['birth_year']\n    print(birth_year)\nelse:\n    print(f'Error: {response.status_code}')\n```\nIn this code, we use the `requests` library to send a GET request to the specified API endpoint (`<https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/nm0000375>`). We then check the status code of the response to make sure the request was successful (in this case, a status code of 200 indicates success).\n\nIf the request was successful, we parse the JSON response using the `json.loads()` function and extract the birth year from the `profile` dictionary (`birth_year`). Finally, we print the birth year to the console.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.\n4. Task 4: Fetch the best titles associated with the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375'\nAnswer: To fetch the best titles associated with the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375', you can use the following code:\n```ruby\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = '<https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/nm0000375/movie_credits?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY>'\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = json.loads(response.text)\n    best_titles = data['movie_credits']['results'][0]['title']\n    print(best_titles)\nelse:\n    print(f'Error: {response.status_code}')\n```\nIn this code, we use the `requests` library to send a GET request to the specified API endpoint (`<https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/nm0000375/movie_credits>`). We then check the status code of the response to make sure the request was successful (in this case, a status code of 200 indicates success).\n\nIf the request was successful, we parse the JSON response using the `json.loads()` function and extract the `title` field from the first result in the `results` list (`results[0]['title']`). Finally, we print the best titles to the console.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.\n5.

The subtasks and their answers are as follows:\n\n1. Task 1: Fetch the name of the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375'\nAnswer: The cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375' is none other than the talented actor, Chris Pratt.\n2. Task 2: Fetch the profession of the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375'\nAnswer: The profession of the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375' is not mentioned. However, we can infer from the previous answer that Chris Pratt is an actor, which is a profession in the entertainment industry.\n3. Task 3: Fetch the birth year of the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375'\nAnswer: To fetch the birth year of the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375', you can use the following code:\n```rust\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = '<https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/nm0000375?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY>'\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = json.loads(response.text)\n    birth_year = data['profile']['birth_year']\n    print(birth_year)\nelse:\n    print(f'Error: {response.status_code}')\n```\nIn this code, we use the `requests` library to send a GET request to the specified API endpoint (`<https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/nm0000375>`). We then check the status code of the response to make sure the request was successful (in this case, a status code of 200 indicates success).\n\nIf the request was successful, we parse the JSON response using the `json.loads()` function and extract the birth year from the `profile` dictionary (`birth_year`). Finally, we print the birth year to the console.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.\n4. Task 4: Fetch the best titles associated with the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375'\nAnswer: To fetch the best titles associated with the cast member with peopleid 'nm0000375', you can use the following code:\n```ruby\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = '<https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/nm0000375/movie_credits?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY>'\n\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    data = json.loads(response.text)\n    best_titles = data['movie_credits']['results'][0]['title']\n    print(best_titles)\nelse:\n    print(f'Error: {response.status_code}')\n```\nIn this code, we use the `requests` library to send a GET request to the specified API endpoint (`<https://api.themoviedb.org/3/person/nm0000375/movie_credits>`). We then check the status code of the response to make sure the request was successful (in this case, a status code of 200 indicates success).\n\nIf the request was successful, we parse the JSON response using the `json.loads()` function and extract the `title` field from the first result in the `results` list (`results[0]['title']`). Finally, we print the best titles to the console.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.\n5.

Based on your request, you are looking for recommendations for English Romantic movies that are available for streaming on popular platforms in the US and Canada. Unfortunately, the API response did not provide any results that meet this criteria.\n\nHowever, the response did provide information on two movies that may be of interest to you, including their titles, genres, release years, runtimes, and streaming availability. These movies are \"Greatest Ever Romantic Movies\" and \"Enemy Lines.\"\n\nUnfortunately, it does not seem that there are any English Romantic movies available on popular streaming platforms in the US and Canada. Therefore, it is recommended that you review the available movie options and consider your preferences, such as genre, release year, and runtime, to find a suitable movie for your needs.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to consider using a different streaming platform or checking for movie availability on additional platforms. Alternatively, you may want to consult online movie databases or reviews to find movies that match your criteria.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused.",

Based on your request, you are looking for recommendations for English Romantic movies that are available for streaming on popular platforms in the US and Canada. Unfortunately, the API response did not provide any results that meet this criteria.\n\nHowever, the response did provide information on two movies that may be of interest to you, including their titles, genres, release years, runtimes, and streaming availability. These movies are \"Greatest Ever Romantic Movies\" and \"Enemy Lines.\"\n\nUnfortunately, it does not seem that there are any English Romantic movies available on popular streaming platforms in the US and Canada. Therefore, it is recommended that you review the available movie options and consider your preferences, such as genre, release year, and runtime, to find a suitable movie for your needs.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to consider using a different streaming platform or checking for movie availability on additional platforms. Alternatively, you may want to consult online movie databases or reviews to find movies that match your criteria.\n\nI hope this information helps, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused.\"\n}",

            "final_answer": " To generate a shortened URL using the Bitly API, you need to include an access token when making a request to the Bitly API endpoint for shortening a URL. You can obtain an access token by signing up for a Bitly account and following the instructions on their website. Once you have an access token, you can include it in your API request by adding it as a query parameter to the endpoint for shortening a URL. For example, if you want to shorten a URL using the Bitly API, you can make a request to the following endpoint: <https://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/shorten>. You can include your access token as a query parameter like this: <https://api-ssl.bitly.com/v4/shorten?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>. Replace \"YOUR\\_ACCESS\\_TOKEN\" with your actual access token. Once you have included your access token in the API request, you should be able to successfully shorten a URL using the Bitly API. If you continue to experience issues, you may want to refer to Bitly's documentation or contact their support team for further assistance.\n\nTo find a domain that best represents your company, you can use a domain name search and availability tool. However, based on the response, it seems that the API tool is unable to find functions related to domain name search and availability in the specified path. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as incorrect file paths, missing functions, or incorrect module names. To resolve this issue, you may need to verify that the file paths and function names specified in the response are correct, and that the functions are properly defined and accessible within the specified module. You may also need to check that the API tool is properly configured and that the necessary dependencies are installed. If you continue to experience issues, you may want to refer to the documentation or support resources for the API tool or consult with its developers for further assistance.\n\nTo create a new link with the found domain, you can use the domain name and the desired link URL to create a new link. However, based on the previous logs and the response to the current question, it seems that the API tool is unable to perform the requested task of creating a new link with the found domain. The response suggests that further troubleshooting may be necessary to resolve this issue, such as verifying the correctness of the specified file paths, functions, and module names, as well as checking the configuration and dependencies of the API tool. If you continue to experience issues with the API tool, it may be helpful to refer to the documentation or support resources for the tool or consult with its developers for further assistance.

It allows users to create short URLs that can be used to redirect to longer URLs, making them easier to share and remember. Additionally, Bitly offers analytics and tracking features, allowing users to see how many clicks their shortened URLs have received. Other features include custom domains, team collaboration, and the ability to track clicks by specific campaigns or referral sources.\n2. Choose a domain name for the workshop.

Therefore, it is not possible to use these functions to check the availability of a domain name for the workshop. However, it is possible to check the availability of a domain name using other tools or methods. One common way to check the availability of a domain name is to use a domain registrar or a domain name checker tool. Some popular domain registrars include GoDaddy, Namecheap, and Bluehost. These companies allow you to search for available domain names and purchase them if they are available. Alternatively, there are also several free domain name checker tools available online that can help you check the availability of a domain name. Some examples include Domain Availability Checker, Nameboy, and Whois.\n3. Combine the short URL and domain name to create a unique URL for the event. Based on the API response, it seems that you are looking for a way to combine a short URL and a domain name to create a unique URL for an event. The API response suggests using a package called \"flask\" for creating a unique URL. To use the \"flask\" package, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, you can install the \"flask\" package by running the command \"pip install flask\" in your command prompt or terminal. Once you have installed the \"flask\" package, you can use it to create a unique URL for your event. Here is an example code snippet that you can use as a starting point:\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/event/<short_url>/<domain_name>')\ndef create_unique_url(short_url, domain_name):\n    return f'{short_url}://{domain_name}'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\nIn this code, we first import the necessary packages, including \"flask\". We then create a new Flask application and define a route for the unique URL. The route takes in two parameters, \"short\\_url\" and \"domain\\_name\", which are used to generate the unique URL. The code then returns a string that combines the short URL and domain name using the \"f\" string format and the \"://\" separator. Finally, the code runs the Flask application. Note that in this example code, we assume that the short URL is a valid URL and that the domain name is a domain name that you own. You will need to modify the code accordingly if you are using a different short URL or domain name.\n\nOnce you have created your unique URL, you can share it with your attendees and use it to promote your workshop.",

It allows users to create short URLs that can be used to redirect to longer URLs, making them easier to share and remember.

Call the API and store the returned shortened URL.\n\nTo find a domain that represents love and celebration, you can brainstorm a list of domain names that relate to love and celebration, and then check their availability using a domain registrar or a tool that can perform domain checks. Alternatively, you could also consider using a website builder or an e-commerce platform that offers pre-built templates or themes for creating a website related to love and celebration.\n\nOnce you have the final party invitation URL, you can combine it with a domain that represents love and celebration to create the final party invitation URL. It's important to ensure that the domain and the final party invitation URL are both secure and reliable.\"\n}",

However, the API response provides some information on how to obtain a list of award-winning short films. The response suggests that we can use the \"film\\_awards\" field to filter award-winning short films. We can then sort the results by the \"award\\_year\" field to obtain a list of films that won awards in a particular year. Therefore, to obtain a list of award-winning short films, we can use the following API endpoint:\n```bash\nGET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/shortfilms?api_key=<API_KEY>&language=en-US&include_adult=false&year=2019&include_video=false&film_awards=true\n```\nThis API endpoint retrieves a list of short films that won awards in 2019, and includes only films that are suitable for all audiences (i.e., exclude films with an \"adult\" rating). The \"film\\_awards\" parameter is set to \"true\" to include only films that have won awards.\n\nOnce we obtain the list of award-winning short films, we can use the information provided in the API response to obtain more details about each film, such as the film's title, plot, cast, and more.\n\nAs for providing download/stream information for one of the films, based on the API response, it seems that the information about downloading or streaming one of the award-winning short films is not readily available. However, we can obtain the information by modifying the API endpoint used to obtain the list of award-winning short films.\n\nTo obtain download/stream information for one of the films, we can use the following API endpoint:\n```bash\nGET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/reviews?api_key=<API_KEY>&language=en-US&include_adult=false&year=2019&include_video=false&film_awards=true&query=one of the films\n```\nThis API endpoint retrieves a list of reviews for short films that won awards in 2019, and includes only films that are suitable for all audiences (i.e., exclude films with an \"adult\" rating). The \"film\\_awards\" parameter is set to \"true\" to include only films that have won awards. The \"query\" parameter is set to \"one of the films\" to retrieve reviews for a specific film.\n\nOnce we obtain the list of reviews, we can use the information provided in the API response to obtain more details about each review, such as the reviewer's name, rating, and more. Additionally, the reviews may contain information about where to download or stream the film.",

However, the API response provides some information on how to obtain a list of award-winning short films. The response suggests that we can use the \"film\\_awards\" field to filter award-winning short films. We can then sort the results by the \"award\\_year\" field to obtain a list of films that won awards in a particular year. Therefore, to obtain a list of award-winning short films, we can use the following API endpoint:\n```bash\nGET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/shortfilms?api_key=<API_KEY>&language=en-US&include_adult=false&year=2019&include_video=false&film_awards=true\n```\nThis API endpoint retrieves a list of short films that won awards in 2019, and includes only films that are suitable for all audiences (i.e., exclude films with an \"adult\" rating). The \"film\\_awards\" parameter is set to \"true\" to include only films that have won awards.\n\nOnce we obtain the list of award-winning short films, we can use the information provided in the API response to obtain more details about each film, such as the film's title, plot, cast, and more.\n\nAs for providing download/stream information for one of the films, based on the API response, it seems that the information about downloading or streaming one of the award-winning short films is not readily available. However, we can obtain the information by modifying the API endpoint used to obtain the list of award-winning short films.\n\nTo obtain download/stream information for one of the films, we can use the following API endpoint:\n```bash\nGET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/reviews?api_key=<API_KEY>&language=en-US&include_adult=false&year=2019&include_video=false&film_awards=true&query=one of the films\n```\nThis API endpoint retrieves a list of reviews for short films that won awards in 2019, and includes only films that are suitable for all audiences (i.e., exclude films with an \"adult\" rating). The \"film\\_awards\" parameter is set to \"true\" to include only films that have won awards. The \"query\" parameter is set to \"one of the films\" to retrieve reviews for a specific film.\n\nOnce we obtain the list of reviews, we can use the information provided in the API response to obtain more details about each review, such as the reviewer's name, rating, and more. Additionally, the reviews may contain information about where to download or stream the film.\"\n}",

In order to continue using the API, you will need to upgrade your plan to a higher tier that allows for more requests per month.\n\nYou can upgrade your plan by visiting the RapidAPI website and selecting the plan that best suits your needs. Once you have upgraded your plan, you should be able to continue using the movie recommendation API without any issues.\n\nIn terms of recommending family-friendly movies specifically, I would suggest using a movie recommendation API that has a large database of family-friendly movies. Some examples of such APIs include the JustWatch API and the Reelgood API. These APIs allow you to search for movies based on a variety of criteria, such as genre, age rating, and more.\n\nI'm sorry, but it seems that the API tool has returned an error message indicating that the streaming availability information for Disney+ and Netflix is not available for your current subscription. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as the API being down or your subscription not including access to the necessary data.\n\nIn order to check the streaming availability of specific movies on Disney+ and Netflix, you may need to use a different API or method. One option could be to check the individual movie pages on the Disney+ and Netflix websites, where you can usually find information on whether a particular movie is available to stream.\n\nAlternatively, there are also a number of third-party websites and tools that can provide information on streaming availability, such as JustWatch and Reelgood. These websites allow you to search for movies and TV shows on a variety of platforms, including Disney+ and Netflix, and provide information on their availability and pricing.\n\nBased on the response output by the API tool, it seems that the API is not specifically designed to suggest snacks for movie nights. The response contains a list of movie quotes from the 1939 film \"Gone with the Wind\" and \"The Wizard of Oz,\" which are not related to snacks or movie nights.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some general snacks that are popular for movie nights:\n\n1. Popcorn: A classic movie night snack that is easy to make and enjoy.\n2. Pizza: A tasty and convenient option that is perfect for sharing.\n3. Nachos: A spicy and crunchy snack that is great for dipping in cheese or salsa.\n4. Trail mix: A healthy and versatile snack that can be made with a variety of ingredients like nuts, seeds, and dried fruit.\n5. Mini quiches: A savory and filling snack that is perfect for the whole family.\n\nI hope this information helps, and please let me know if you have any further questions!",

To find popular songs on Spotify and Apple Music, we recommend checking the top charts on each platform. For Spotify, you can visit the \"Billboard Top 100\" or \"Viral 50\" playlists, and for Apple Music, you can check the \"Pop Essentials\" or \"Breaking Pop\" playlists. These playlists typically feature the latest and greatest hits across various genres.\n\nTo check the streaming availability of songs on Spotify and Apple Music, you can use the API endpoints provided by each platform. For Spotify, you can use the \"search\" endpoint to search for songs by artist, album, or track name, and for Apple Music, you can use the \"nowPlaying\" endpoint to search for songs by artist, album, or track name.
