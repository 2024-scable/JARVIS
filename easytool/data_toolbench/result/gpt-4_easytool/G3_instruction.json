I will provide a search value such as \"Casablanca\" or \"Gone with the Wind\" and set the search type to include movies only. This should give me a list of classic movie titles as results. I will proceed with this new action.",

Ensure consistent URL structure across the website, use hyphens to separate words, avoid using special characters, and finally, test the URLs to make sure they are working properly.\n\n5. **Generate short, catchy URLs for the website using the Bitly tool:** At the moment, we're unable to generate short URLs for your website because the access token is missing.

Nichols. Directed and written by Mike Flanagan. However, please note that as per the data, this movie is currently not playable. The movie revolves around Mark and Jessie, who are still mourning the death of their son. They welcome a foster child, Cody, into their lives and soon discover that he has a strange ability.\n\n2. \"Death Note\" - Available for streaming, it features Willem Dafoe, Nat Wolff, LaKeith Stanfield, Margaret Qualley, Shea Whigham, Paul Nakauchi, and Jason Liles. The film was directed by Adam Wingard and written by Charley Parlapanides, Vlas Parlapanides, and Jeremy Slater. It belongs to the 'Horror Movies' genre and has tags like 'Mind-Bending', 'Violent', and 'Scary'. \n\nPlease note the availability of these movies can change, so it's always a good idea to check their current status on your preferred streaming platform.\n\nAs for comedy movie titles, it seems that we've exceeded our monthly request quota for the movie listing API. Therefore, I recommend visiting popular streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime directly to find comedy movies. Alternatively, you can also use movie database websites like IMDb to find comedy movies available on streaming platforms in the US.\n\nRegarding the movie 'Get Out', it has a skillful cast including:\n1. Daniel Kaluuya, an actor, playing the character Chris Washington.\n2. Allison Williams, an actress, playing the character Rose Armitage.\n3. Bradley Whitford, an actor, playing the character Dean Armitage.\n\nThese are the main cast members for the movie 'Get Out'.",

Nichols. Directed and written by Mike Flanagan. However, please note that as per the data, this movie is currently not playable. The movie revolves around Mark and Jessie, who are still mourning the death of their son. They welcome a foster child, Cody, into their lives and soon discover that he has a strange ability.\n\n2. \"Death Note\" - Available for streaming, it features Willem Dafoe, Nat Wolff, LaKeith Stanfield, Margaret Qualley, Shea Whigham, Paul Nakauchi, and Jason Liles. The film was directed by Adam Wingard and written by Charley Parlapanides, Vlas Parlapanides, and Jeremy Slater. It belongs to the 'Horror Movies' genre and has tags like 'Mind-Bending', 'Violent', and 'Scary'. \n\nPlease note the availability of these movies can change, so it's always a good idea to check their current status on your preferred streaming platform.\n\nAs for comedy movie titles, it seems that we've exceeded our monthly request quota for the movie listing API. Therefore, I recommend visiting popular streaming platforms like Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime directly to find comedy movies. Alternatively, you can also use movie database websites like IMDb to find comedy movies available on streaming platforms in the US.\n\nRegarding the movie 'Get Out', it has a skillful cast including:\n1. Daniel Kaluuya, an actor, playing the character Chris Washington.\n2. Allison Williams, an actress, playing the character Rose Armitage.\n3. Bradley Whitford, an actor, playing the character Dean Armitage.\n\nThese are the main cast members for the movie 'Get Out'.\"\n}",

Here's how to do that:\n\n1. Open your web browser and navigate to Bitly's website at https://bitly.com/.\n   \n2. If you don't already have an account, click on the \"Sign Up\" button at the top right of the screen. Fill in the required information and create your account.\n   \n3. Once you're signed in, you'll be taken to the dashboard. Here, you'll see a button labeled \"Create\" in the top right corner. Click on it.\n   \n4. A small window will pop up. In the \"Paste long URL\" box, paste the URL you want to shorten and press the \"Create\" button.\n   \n5. Bitly will automatically generate a short URL for you. If you want, you can customize this URL by clicking on the \"Edit\" button next to it. This allows you to choose a more descriptive or memorable URL.\n   \n6. Once you're happy with your short URL, click on the \"Save\" button. Your new short URL is now ready to use.\n   \n7. You can repeat these steps for each URL you need to shorten for your project.\n\nRemember, creating a Bitly account also allows you to track how many clicks each of your short URLs receive, which can be very useful for analyzing the reach of your project.",

Here's how to do that:\n\n1. Open your web browser and navigate to Bitly's website at https://bitly.com/.\n   \n2. If you don't already have an account, click on the \"Sign Up\" button at the top right of the screen. Fill in the required information and create your account.\n   \n3. Once you're signed in, you'll be taken to the dashboard. Here, you'll see a button labeled \"Create\" in the top right corner. Click on it.\n   \n4. A small window will pop up. In the \"Paste long URL\" box, paste the URL you want to shorten and press the \"Create\" button.\n   \n5. Bitly will automatically generate a short URL for you. If you want, you can customize this URL by clicking on the \"Edit\" button next to it. This allows you to choose a more descriptive or memorable URL.\n   \n6. Once you're happy with your short URL, click on the \"Save\" button. Your new short URL is now ready to use.\n   \n7. You can repeat these steps for each URL you need to shorten for your project.\n\nRemember, creating a Bitly account also allows you to track how many clicks each of your short URLs receive, which can be very useful for analyzing the reach of your project.\"\n}",

Use travel apps to find attractions, restaurants, and hotels along your route. \n\n2. Pack Smart: Pack essential items like snacks, water, first aid kit, extra clothes, blankets, pillows, and entertainment for kids. Don't forget your chargers and power banks for your electronic devices.\n\n3. Entertainment for Kids: Bring a variety of games, books, and toys to keep the kids entertained during the journey. You can also download their favorite movies or shows.\n\n4. Frequent Breaks: Take frequent breaks to stretch, eat and rest. This can help to prevent fatigue and keep everyone in a good mood.\n\n5. Safety First: Make sure your vehicle is in good condition before the trip. Always have a spare tire and know how to change it.\n\n6. Healthy Snacks: Carry a cooler with fruits, sandwiches, and other healthy snacks. This will save you money and prevent unhealthy fast food stops.\n\n7. Comfortable Clothing: Wear and pack comfortable clothing for everyone. Layer your clothes so you can easily adjust to the changing temperatures.\n\n8. Keep It Clean: Keep a trash bag in the car to maintain cleanliness and organization.\n\n9. Stay Flexible: While it's good to plan, be flexible with your plans. You might find interesting spots along the way that were not on your original route.\n\n10. Have Fun: Enjoy the journey as much as the destination. Make lasting memories with your family.\n\nAs for the video with ID '678901', here are some comments:\n\n1.

Plan Ahead: Plan your route and stops in advance. Use travel apps to find attractions, restaurants, and hotels along your route. \n\n2. Pack Smart: Pack essential items like snacks, water, first aid kit, extra clothes, blankets, pillows, and entertainment for kids. Don't forget your chargers and power banks for your electronic devices.\n\n3. Entertainment for Kids: Bring a variety of games, books, and toys to keep the kids entertained during the journey. You can also download their favorite movies or shows.\n\n4. Frequent Breaks: Take frequent breaks to stretch, eat and rest. This can help to prevent fatigue and keep everyone in a good mood.\n\n5. Safety First: Make sure your vehicle is in good condition before the trip. Always have a spare tire and know how to change it.\n\n6. Healthy Snacks: Carry a cooler with fruits, sandwiches, and other healthy snacks. This will save you money and prevent unhealthy fast food stops.\n\n7. Comfortable Clothing: Wear and pack comfortable clothing for everyone. Layer your clothes so you can easily adjust to the changing temperatures.\n\n8. Keep It Clean: Keep a trash bag in the car to maintain cleanliness and organization.\n\n9. Stay Flexible: While it's good to plan, be flexible with your plans. You might find interesting spots along the way that were not on your original route.\n\n10. Have Fun: Enjoy the journey as much as the destination. Make lasting memories with your family.\n\nAs for the video with ID '678901', here are some comments:\n\n1.

Here's a combined guide to help you with your sister's birthday surprise.\n\nFirstly, let's start with creating a slideshow with her childhood photos:\n\n1. **Gather Your Photos**: Collect all the childhood photos you want to include in your slideshow. If they are physical, you'll need to scan them to create digital versions.\n\n2. **Choose a Slideshow Maker**: Select a tool to create your slideshow. Examples include PowerPoint, Google Slides, Adobe Spark, Canva, or iMovie for Mac users.\n\n3. **Upload Photos**: Upload your photos to the chosen tool. Most tools allow you to drag and drop or select photos from your files.\n\n4. **Arrange Photos**: Arrange your photos in the order you want them to appear. This could be chronologically, thematically, or in any other order that suits your story.\n\n5. **Add Transitions and Effects**: Add transitions between photos to make your slideshow smoother. You can also add effects to your photos.\n\n6. **Add Text**: You might be able to add text to your photos or between them. This can be useful for providing context or sharing memories associated with each picture.\n\n7. **Include Music**: Consider adding a soundtrack that reflects the mood of your slideshow.\n\n8. **Preview and Edit**: Always preview your slideshow before finalizing it. This will allow you to spot any errors and make necessary adjustments.\n\n9. **Save and Share**: Save your slideshow. You can then share it digitally through email or social media, or present it physically using a projector or TV screen.\n\nNow, let's move to the Vimeo videos:\n\n1. Go to the video page on Vimeo that you'd like to download.\n2. Scroll down the page and look for the \"Download\" button below the video description on the right.\n3. Click the \"Download\" button.\n4. A pop-up window will appear with different video quality options like SD, HD, and Original. Click the quality of video you'd like to download.\n5. The video will then start downloading automatically.\n6. Please make sure you have permission to download the video. You may need to be logged into Vimeo to download videos, and the availability of downloads depends on the settings chosen by the video uploader.\n\nLastly, here's how you can stream videos using the YTStream - Download YouTube Videos tool:\n\n1. Open your web browser and visit the YTStream website.\n2. Enter the URL of the YouTube video you want to stream or manually input keywords of the video in the search bar.\n3. After entering the URL or keywords, click on the 'Search' button or press Enter.\n4. The search results will be displayed on the screen. Find the video you want to stream from the list and click on it.\n5. The video will start streaming on the website. You can control the video playback using the play, pause, forward, and rewind buttons.\n6. If you want to download the video, click on the 'Download' button below the video player, choose the video quality, and click on 'Download' again.\n\nPlease ensure that you have a stable and fast internet connection for a smooth streaming and downloading experience. Enjoy planning your surprise!",

Click on the \"Copy\" button next to the short URL. The URL is now copied to your clipboard and you can paste it anywhere you'd like to share it, such as social media platforms, emails, etc. Remember to save it somewhere secure if you plan to use it frequently.\n\n2. To create a branded short link, open your preferred URL Link Shortener tool. There should be a field or box somewhere on the page that says something like \"Enter your long URL here\". Copy the URL of the website you want to shorten and paste it into this box. Click the button that says \"Shorten URL\", \"Create\", or something similar. The tool will then generate a shortened version of your URL. If the tool offers branded short links, you might need to specify your desired brand text. Once your new shortened (and potentially branded) URL is generated, it should be ready to use.\n\n3. After shortening a URL, the tool provides a new shorter link. You can copy it by clicking on the 'Copy' button next to the link or by manually selecting the link and using the keyboard shortcut 'Ctrl+C' (Windows) or 'Command+C' (Mac). To save it, you can paste it in a secure location like a Word document, a note-taking app, or any other place where you usually store important links, using 'Ctrl+V' (Windows) or 'Command+V' (Mac).\n\nPlease follow these steps on your device.

Open your web browser and go to the Bitly website (www.bitly.com).\n2. Click on the \"Log In\" button located at the top right corner of the site.\n3. Enter your username and password in the fields provided. If you used a social media account to sign up for Bitly, click on the corresponding icon instead.\n4. Once you've filled in your details, click on the \"Log In\" button to access your account. \n5. Look for a button or field that says \"Create\" or \"Shorten\".\n6. Paste the URL of your social media post into the field that appears.\n7. Click on the \"Shorten\" or \"Create\" button.\n\nThe site should then provide you with a shortened version of your URL. Remember to ensure you're logged into your Bitly account before attempting this process.\n\nTo track and record the engagement of each post, you can:\n\n1. Log into your Bitly account.\n2. Click on the 'Stats' section.\n3. Here you can find a dashboard displaying all the engagement metrics for your created short URLs like clicks, locations, referrers, and more.\n\nAs for creating branded short links for your website using a URL Link Shortener tool, I would need to know which specific tool you're using to provide detailed steps. However, the general steps are:\n\n1. Log into your URL shortener tool.\n2. Paste the full URL that you want to shorten into the designated input field.\n3. If the tool supports creating a branded short link, there should be an option to customize the short link. Enter your branding there.\n4. Click the button to create or shorten the URL. The tool will then generate a shortened URL for you.\n\nRemember to save the link in a convenient location and to use it, simply paste it wherever you want to share it. The exact steps may vary slightly depending on the specific URL shortener tool you're using.",

Open your web browser and go to the Bitly website (www.bitly.com).\n2. Click on the \"Log In\" button located at the top right corner of the site.\n3. Enter your username and password in the fields provided. If you used a social media account to sign up for Bitly, click on the corresponding icon instead.\n4. Once you've filled in your details, click on the \"Log In\" button to access your account. \n5. Look for a button or field that says \"Create\" or \"Shorten\".\n6. Paste the URL of your social media post into the field that appears.\n7. Click on the \"Shorten\" or \"Create\" button.\n\nThe site should then provide you with a shortened version of your URL. Remember to ensure you're logged into your Bitly account before attempting this process.\n\nTo track and record the engagement of each post, you can:\n\n1. Log into your Bitly account.\n2. Click on the 'Stats' section.\n3. Here you can find a dashboard displaying all the engagement metrics for your created short URLs like clicks, locations, referrers, and more.\n\nAs for creating branded short links for your website using a URL Link Shortener tool, I would need to know which specific tool you're using to provide detailed steps. However, the general steps are:\n\n1. Log into your URL shortener tool.\n2. Paste the full URL that you want to shorten into the designated input field.\n3. If the tool supports creating a branded short link, there should be an option to customize the short link. Enter your branding there.\n4. Click the button to create or shorten the URL. The tool will then generate a shortened URL for you.\n\nRemember to save the link in a convenient location and to use it, simply paste it wherever you want to share it. The exact steps may vary slightly depending on the specific URL shortener tool you're using.\"\n}",

Books: They are a collection of pages that are organized and bound together, filled with text, illustrations, or both. Books cover a vast array of topics, including fiction, non-fiction, academic subjects, self-help guides, children's stories, and many more.

Two such films are \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" and \"Saw X\". \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" is a chilling tale about a troubled man named Mike who works as a night security guard at an abandoned restaurant and discovers some disturbing truths. The movie boasts a popularity rating of 4529.373 and an average vote of 8.3. It's set to be released on October 25, 2023. \n\n\"Saw X\" is a film set between the events of 'Saw' and 'Saw II'. It follows John Kramer, a desperate man suffering from cancer who travels to Mexico for a risky medical procedure. After discovering that the operation is a scam, he sets out to exact revenge on the con artists in his signature gruesome way. The movie has a popularity rating of 1619.014 and an average vote of 7.4. It's scheduled for release on September 26, 2023. \n\nBoth these movies can be streamed in the United States, however, the exact streaming platforms have not been specified. I suggest checking popular platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, or Disney+ for availability. \n\nUnfortunately, I am currently unable to report the streaming sources available in Canada for these films due to a monthly quota limit on the streaming guide API tool in use. You may want to try again next month or consider upgrading the plan for more requests. For more details, please visit the [link](https://rapidapi.com/StreamlineWatch/api/streamlinewatch-streaming-guide). \n\nI hope this helps and you enjoy your movie night!",

Two such films are \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" and \"Saw X\". \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" is a chilling tale about a troubled man named Mike who works as a night security guard at an abandoned restaurant and discovers some disturbing truths. The movie boasts a popularity rating of 4529.373 and an average vote of 8.3. It's set to be released on October 25, 2023. \n\n\"Saw X\" is a film set between the events of 'Saw' and 'Saw II'. It follows John Kramer, a desperate man suffering from cancer who travels to Mexico for a risky medical procedure. After discovering that the operation is a scam, he sets out to exact revenge on the con artists in his signature gruesome way. The movie has a popularity rating of 1619.014 and an average vote of 7.4. It's scheduled for release on September 26, 2023. \n\nBoth these movies can be streamed in the United States, however, the exact streaming platforms have not been specified. I suggest checking popular platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, or Disney+ for availability. \n\nUnfortunately, I am currently unable to report the streaming sources available in Canada for these films due to a monthly quota limit on the streaming guide API tool in use. You may want to try again next month or consider upgrading the plan for more requests. For more details, please visit the [link](https://rapidapi.com/StreamlineWatch/api/streamlinewatch-streaming-guide). \n\nI hope this helps and you enjoy your movie night!\"\n}",

It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing, art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication. There are several types of photography, including Portrait, Photojournalism, Sports, Still Life, Editorial, Architectural, Wedding, Aerial, Pet, and Astrophotography. Photography requires knowledge about camera mechanisms, such as aperture, shutter speed, ISO, and focus. It also requires understanding light, composition, color, and storytelling.\n\n2. **Comments on the video with ID '901234'**: Here are some of the comments for the video with the ID '901234': User @jonadol commented, \"I can still remember when Adele broke the internet when she released this silently. I hope she does it again this year.\" This comment was made 3 years ago and has received 57K likes. There are also comments from other users like @user-fy9qd9el6w, @BassNeonExtreme, @ErrorCodeGamingX59, @TUSHARMandal-mf4de, and @Soluchi-InfiniteCoCreatorGod, sharing their thoughts and feelings about the video.\n\n3. **Website to stream or download tutorial video on wildlife photography with the ID 'UxxajLWwzqY'**: The video ID 'UxxajLWwzqY' you provided seems to be titled 'Icona Pop - I Love It (feat. Charli XCX) [OFFICIAL VIDEO]', and is authored by 'Icona Pop'. It does not seem to be a tutorial video on wildlife photography. However, if you still want to download this video, you can do so from the links provided in different resolutions.\n\nPlease note that we could not provide the channel info for 'National Geographic' as it was not mentioned in the subtasks. If you want, we can fetch that information as well.",
